        Unfortunately, you have been unsuccessful in passing the test overall in this instance. However, you are eligible to sit a supplementary test for the task(s) where you have not achieved the required level of performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should you wish to sit a supplementary certification test, please email <a href="mailto://info@naati.com.au">info@naati.com.au</a> indicating this. NAATI will arrange for this supplementary test and advise you of the next available test date. Please note a test re-sit fee will apply.

    <p>
        Alternatively, you are able to apply for a review of your test result by <a href="https://my.naati.com.au/Applications/MyTestResults">clicking here</a>. Please note that you cannot order a test review if you have submitted an application for a supplementary certification test.
