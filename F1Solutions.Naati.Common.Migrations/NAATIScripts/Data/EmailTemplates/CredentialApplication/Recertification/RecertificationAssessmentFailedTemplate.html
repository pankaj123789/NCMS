    <p>
        Please be aware that your current credential is set to expire on [[Credential Expiry Date]]. Whilst expired credentials can still be verified (using a Practitioner ID) via our online verification tool, they are no longer searchable in our Online Directory of Translators and Interpreters.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to re-gain this credential in future, you will need to submit a new certification application. We would urge you to look at the information regarding NAATI certification on our website to learn more about alternative pathways for gaining a NAATI credential.
